# Task: inverting x5 AC amplifier

## Problem report

The first boards built from these files fail bring-up. Find and fix all problems: the design must meet its purpose and spec, the layout must match design.json, and DRC/ERC must be clean.

## Design intent

# Inverting x5 AC amplifier (single supply)

Amplifies an AC signal on J2 (pin 1 = input, pin 2 = GND) with a gain of -5 and outputs it on
J3 (pin 1 = output, pin 2 = GND), centred at mid-supply. Single 5 V supply on J1
(pin 1 = VCC, pin 2 = GND).

- U1 (OPAMP): V+ on VCC (decoupled by C1 at the pin), V- on GND.
- Mid-supply reference: equal resistors R3 (VCC to VMID) and R4 (VMID to GND), bypassed by C3 to GND;
  VMID drives the non-inverting input.
- The input is AC-coupled: J2 pin 1 -> C2 -> R1 -> IN-. R2 is the feedback resistor from OUT to IN-.
  Gain = -R2/R1; the coupling capacitor sets the low cut-off 1/(2π·R1·C2) ≈ 10 Hz.

Spec: output DC level VCC/2 ±3 %; |gain| 5 ±3 % at 1 kHz; low -3 dB corner 10.4 Hz ±15 %.
Component values: decoupling C1 47 nF–10 µF (100 nF typical); bias divider R3, R4 4.7 kΩ–470 kΩ each;
VMID bypass C3 470 nF–47 µF.

Sub-circuits by purpose: supply connector (J1); op-amp with supply decoupling (U1, C1); mid-supply bias divider and bypass (R3, R4, C3); input coupling capacitor (C2); gain-setting input and feedback resistors (R1, R2); input connector (J2); output connector (J3).

## Spec

The design must satisfy these assertions (`pcbtool sim` runs them; full definitions in `spec.json`):

- `dc_bias_out`: DC voltage at J3.1 between 2.425 V and 2.575 V (J1.1 supplied with 5.0 V; 1.0 V AC source on J2.1; ground = J1.2)
- `midband_gain`: AC gain |V(J3.1)/V(J2.1)| at 1 kHz between 4.85 and 5.15 (J1.1 supplied with 5.0 V; 1.0 V AC source on J2.1; ground = J1.2)
- `low_cutoff`: -3 dB frequency from J2.1 to J3.1 between 8.834 Hz and 11.95 Hz (J1.1 supplied with 5.0 V; 1.0 V AC source on J2.1; ground = J1.2)

Layout: every track of these nets must be at least the given width:

- GND (the net of J1.2): ≥ 0.3 mm
- VCC (the net of J1.1): ≥ 0.3 mm

Decoupling: every pad of each capacitor within the given distance of the IC pin's pad:

- C1 within 5.0 mm of U1.V+

Component values: each value must lie in its acceptable range (inclusive; `value_bounds` in `spec.json`). Ranges come from the datasheets and the design intent; values the assertions already pin down get a wide sanity range, and the assertions still apply:

- C1 (C): 47 nF … 10 uF
- C2 (C): 900 nF … 12 uF
- C3 (C): 470 nF … 47 uF
- R1 (R): 1.5 kΩ … 16 kΩ
- R2 (R): 7 kΩ … 85 kΩ
- R3 (R): 4.7 kΩ … 470 kΩ
- R4 (R): 4.7 kΩ … 470 kΩ

Board rules: 2 copper layers, clearance 0.2 mm, min track 0.2 mm, vias 0.6/0.3 mm, copper-to-edge 0.3 mm. DRC must be clean with no unconnected items.

## Design rules (design review)

Besides the spec, the design must pass an engineering design review. **`pcbtool` does not check any
of this — review the design yourself** against the datasheets in `parts/` (see each part's ratings /
design-rule section) and the design intent:

- **Absolute maximum ratings** of every part under every operating condition of the spec (no MCU pin
  above its VDD + 0.3 V or below -0.3 V, op-amp inputs within the rails, LDO EN ≤ VIN, MOSFET |VGS|,
  transistor / diode voltage and current limits).
- **Current limits:** MCU pin currents, LED forward current (by LED package), transistor collector /
  base currents; a saturated NPN switch needs a forced beta IC/IB ≤ 20.
- **Power / voltage ratings:** every resistor's I²R ≤ 50 % of its footprint's rating; every capacitor's
  working voltage ≤ 80 % of its footprint's rated voltage. Footprint choice matters.
- **Inductive loads** have a flyback diode directly across the load, cathode to the supply side.
- **Interfaces and pin assignments** stated in the design intent (connector pinouts, MCU pin functions,
  which rail each part connects to) must be respected exactly, even where the circuit would still
  simulate with a different assignment.

The grader checks these rules under the spec's operating conditions. A design can pass every
`pcbtool` check and still fail review.

## Deliverable

- Edit only `design.json` (the schematic of record) and `board.kicad_pcb` (the layout).
- Do not add, remove or rename components; keep each component's part.
- Keep the two files consistent: same connectivity, values and footprints on both.
- Do not change the board outline, add zones, or add DRC exclusions.
- Footprints must be unmodified library footprints from the part's allowed list (see `parts/<PART>.md`).
- Grading is pass/fail: topology, consistency, DRC, ERC, spec, component values, layout and the design rules above must all pass.

## Tools

Run `pcbtool <command>` inside this directory (you may also edit the two files directly).

Read-only:
- `pcbtool show` — components, values, footprints, positions and nets
- `pcbtool netlist` — design nets vs. board pad nets, with differences highlighted
- `pcbtool drc` — KiCad DRC under the canonical rules (the same rules the grader uses)
- `pcbtool erc` — electrical rule check of design.json
- `pcbtool sim` — run the spec assertions (spec.json) on design.json
- `pcbtool parts [PART]` — list parts / print a part's datasheet (also in `parts/`)
- `pcbtool check` — all of the above in one summary

Mutating (each keeps design.json and board.kicad_pcb consistent and saves both):
- `pcbtool set-value REF VALUE`
- `pcbtool set-footprint REF LIB:FOOTPRINT`
- `pcbtool connect REF.PIN NET` / `pcbtool disconnect REF.PIN`
- `pcbtool move REF X Y ROT` (absolute mm, degrees; tracks do not follow)
- `pcbtool unroute NET` / `pcbtool route NET [--width W]` (re-routes the whole net)
- `pcbtool sync` — push design.json connectivity and values onto the board pads
