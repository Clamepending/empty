Task files: [`../../../tasks/v2/normal/pcbr2-normal-ba117e3d/public/`](../../../tasks/v2/normal/pcbr2-normal-ba117e3d/public/) (what the agent gets) and [`../../../tasks/v2/normal/pcbr2-normal-ba117e3d/hidden/`](../../../tasks/v2/normal/pcbr2-normal-ba117e3d/hidden/) (grader only). Why sampled: 3 faults, connectivity fault, disputable type footprint_swap.

**How to review (≈5 min):** read section 1 as if you were the agent, decide whether you could find and fix the problems from it; then check section 2 (faults, reference fix, verifier verdicts) and fill `review.yaml`. Do not let section 2 influence your fairness judgement of section 1.

# Task: MCU with 24MHz crystal

## Problem report

The first boards built from these files fail bring-up. Observations so far:

- The fab's DRC run rejects the layout: 5 error(s) (3× clearance, 2× solder_mask_bridge).
- The fab's DRC run reports 3 unconnected item(s).
- Layout review: a decoupling capacitor sits too far from the IC pin it decouples.

Fix every problem (there may be more than the observations show directly).

## Design intent

# MCU with 24MHz crystal oscillator

An MCU (U1, MCU8) clocked from a 24MHz crystal Y1 (XTAL_CL18, rated load capacitance 18 pF),
powered from 3.3 V on J1 (pin 1 = +3.3 V, pin 2 = GND).

Spec: effective crystal load CL_eff = C1·C2/(C1+C2) + Cstray within ±10 % of 18 pF
(golden: 17.5 pF); NRST ≥ 0.9·VDD.
Clock: Y1 must be a 24MHz crystal (value `24M`, ±0.1 %): the firmware's clock tree assumes exactly
this frequency, and MCU8 only supports 4–25 MHz crystals.
Component values: decoupling C3 47 nF–10 µF (100 nF typical); NRST pull-up R1 2.2 kΩ–100 kΩ.

Sub-circuits by purpose: supply connector (J1); MCU (U1); VDD decoupling (C3); reset pull-up (R1); crystal oscillator: crystal and load capacitors (Y1, C1, C2).

_Connection details are intentionally not repeated here: wire each part as its datasheet in `parts/` describes (pinout and application notes), so that the circuit does what the purpose, interfaces and spec above require._

## Spec

The design must satisfy these assertions (`pcbtool sim` runs them; full definitions in `spec.json`):

- `xtal_load_capacitance`: crystal Y1 effective load capacitance within ±10 % of its rated CL (stray 2.5 pF)
- `vdd`: DC voltage at U1.VDD relative to U1.GND between 3.234 V and 3.366 V (J1.1 supplied with 3.3 V; ground = J1.2)
- `nrst_high`: DC voltage at U1.NRST between 2.97 V and 3.333 V (J1.1 supplied with 3.3 V; ground = J1.2)

Layout: every track of these nets must be at least the given width:

- +3V3 (the net of J1.1): ≥ 0.3 mm
- GND (the net of J1.2): ≥ 0.3 mm

Decoupling: each capacitor's pad on the IC pin's net must reach the IC pin's pad within the given length of copper path (shortest path along that net's tracks, vias and pads, pad centre to pad centre; a cap wired to the pin the long way round does not decouple it), and every pad of the capacitor must lie within the given straight-line distance of the IC pin's pad:

- C3 within 6.0 mm of copper path of U1.VDD (and within 5.0 mm straight-line)

Component values: each value must lie in its acceptable range (inclusive; `value_bounds` in `spec.json`). Ranges come from the datasheets and the design intent; values the assertions already pin down get a wide sanity range, and the assertions still apply:

- C1 (C): 10 pF … 95 pF
- C2 (C): 11 pF … 100 pF
- C3 (C): 47 nF … 10 uF
- R1 (R): 2.2 kΩ … 100 kΩ
- Y1 (XTAL_CL18): 23.98 MHz … 24.02 MHz

Resistor power rule: every resistor's continuous dissipation I²·R must stay at or below 50 % of its
footprint's rated power (0603 0.1 W, 0805 0.125 W, 1206 0.5 W; see `parts/R.md`). The grader checks
this under the spec's operating conditions; `pcbtool` does not.

Board rules: 2 copper layers, clearance 0.2 mm, min track 0.2 mm, vias 0.6/0.3 mm, copper-to-edge 0.3 mm. DRC must be clean with no unconnected items.

## Deliverable

- Edit only `design.json` (the schematic of record) and `board.kicad_pcb` (the layout).
- Do not add, remove or rename components; keep each component's part.
- Keep the two files consistent: same connectivity, values and footprints on both.
- Values: `<number><SI prefix><unit>` such as `4.7k`, `100n`, `10kΩ`, `1meg`; unit letters, if any, must match the part (R: Ω/ohm/R, C: F, L: H, crystal: Hz); no spaces or control characters inside (full grammar: "Value notation" in `parts/R.md`, `parts/C.md`, ...).
- Do not change the board outline, add zones, or add DRC exclusions.
- Footprints must be unmodified library footprints from the part's allowed list (see `parts/<PART>.md`).
- Grading is pass/fail: topology, consistency, DRC, ERC, spec, component values and layout must all pass.

## Tools

Run `pcbtool <command>` inside this directory (you may also edit the two files directly).

Read-only:
- `pcbtool show` — components, values, footprints, positions and nets
- `pcbtool netlist` — design nets vs. board pad nets, with differences highlighted
- `pcbtool drc` — KiCad DRC under the canonical rules (the same rules the grader uses)
- `pcbtool erc` — electrical rule check of design.json
- `pcbtool sim` — run the spec assertions (spec.json) on design.json
- `pcbtool parts [PART]` — list parts / print a part's datasheet (also in `parts/`)
- `pcbtool check` — all of the above in one summary

Mutating (each keeps design.json and board.kicad_pcb consistent and saves both):
- `pcbtool set-value REF VALUE`
- `pcbtool set-footprint REF LIB:FOOTPRINT`
- `pcbtool connect REF.PIN NET` / `pcbtool disconnect REF.PIN`
- `pcbtool move REF X Y ROT` (absolute mm, degrees; tracks do not follow)
- `pcbtool unroute NET` / `pcbtool route NET [--width W]` (re-routes the whole net)
- `pcbtool sync` — push design.json connectivity and values onto the board pads

### 1.2 Public files

The agent also gets `design.json`, `board.kicad_pcb`, `spec.json` and the part datasheets below, plus the `pcbtool` commands listed in TASK.md (DRC, ERC, simulation of the public assertions, value-range check). Renders of the faulted files:

# C — ceramic capacitor

Two-terminal non-polarised capacitor. Pins `1`, `2`. Value in farads.

## Value notation (all parts)

A value is `<number><SI prefix?><unit?>`, e.g. `4.7k`, `100n`, `2.2u`, `10R`, `1meg`, `1.5e3`:
- number: digits with an optional decimal point and an optional exponent (`1e3`); no sign, no
  digit grouping, no RKM notation (`4k7`);
- SI prefix (case-sensitive): `p` `n` `u`/`µ`/`μ` (micro) `m` (milli) `k`/`K` `M`/`meg`/`MEG` (mega) `G`;
  an exponent and a prefix together (`1e3k`) are rejected;
- unit letters, optional, must match the part: R `Ω`/`ohm`/`Ohm`/`R`; C `F`; L `H`; crystals `Hz`;
  other parts none (`100nH` on a capacitor is rejected);
- no whitespace or control characters inside the value (leading/trailing spaces are ignored).

design.json and the board must carry the same value; they are compared as numbers (`1k` == `1000`).

# MCU8 — generic 8-pin microcontroller (SOIC-8)

## Pinout
| Pin | Pad | Function |
|---|---|---|
| NRST | 1 | active-low reset input. **No internal pull-up**: needs an external pull-up to VDD, 2.2k–100k (10k typical); optional 10 nF–1 µF to GND (100 nF typical) for a power-on reset delay |
| PA1 | 2 | GPIO / ADC1 / XIN (crystal oscillator input) |
| PA2 | 3 | GPIO / ADC2 / XOUT (crystal oscillator output) |
| GND | 4 | ground |
| SDA | 5 | I2C data (open-drain) / GPIO |
| PA0 | 6 | GPIO / PWM output / ADC0 |
| SCL | 7 | I2C clock (open-drain) / GPIO |
| VDD | 8 | supply 1.8–5.5 V |

## Electrical characteristics
- Supply current 1.5 mA typ at 3.3 V
- GPIO output: VOH ≥ VDD - 0.4 V at 8 mA source (≈50 Ω output resistance); 8 mA max per pin
- Open-drain I2C pins sink max 3 mA at VOL = 0.4 V; no internal I2C pull-ups
- ADC (PA0, PA1, PA2): 12-bit, full scale = VDD, input range 0..VDD (never above VDD); the pin
  is high impedance (5 pF), so an RC anti-alias filter at the pin sets the input bandwidth
- Pin capacitance 5 pF per I/O; idle / reset I/O pins are high-impedance (no pulls)
- Crystal oscillator: 4–25 MHz fundamental crystal between XIN (PA1) and XOUT (PA2), each pin
  with a load capacitor to GND

## Application notes
- Decouple VDD with 100 nF ceramic (47 nF–10 µF) to GND within 5 mm of the VDD pin.
- I2C pull-ups: Rp ≥ (VDD - 0.4 V) / 3 mA (sink limit) and Rp ≤ tr / (0.8473 × Cbus) (rise time),
  where tr is the I2C rise time as defined by the I2C specification (UM10204): 30 % to 70 % of
  VDD, max 1000 ns standard-mode / 300 ns fast-mode; 0.8473 = ln(0.7/0.3). Cbus includes
  the 5 pF pin capacitance.
- Crystal load caps: CL = C1·C2/(C1+C2) + Cstray, i.e. C1 = C2 = 2·(CL - Cstray).

# R — resistor

Two-terminal resistor. Pins `1`, `2` (non-polarised). Value in ohms.

## Value notation (all parts)

A value is `<number><SI prefix?><unit?>`, e.g. `4.7k`, `100n`, `2.2u`, `10R`, `1meg`, `1.5e3`:
- number: digits with an optional decimal point and an optional exponent (`1e3`); no sign, no
  digit grouping, no RKM notation (`4k7`);
- SI prefix (case-sensitive): `p` `n` `u`/`µ`/`μ` (micro) `m` (milli) `k`/`K` `M`/`meg`/`MEG` (mega) `G`;
  an exponent and a prefix together (`1e3k`) are rejected;
- unit letters, optional, must match the part: R `Ω`/`ohm`/`Ohm`/`R`; C `F`; L `H`; crystals `Hz`;
  other parts none (`100nH` on a capacitor is rejected);
- no whitespace or control characters inside the value (leading/trailing spaces are ignored).

design.json and the board must carry the same value; they are compared as numbers (`1k` == `1000`).

## Ratings by footprint (high-power thick-film series used on this board)

| Size | Rated power (70 C) | Design limit (50 % derating) |
|---|---|---|
| 0603 | 0.1 W | 50.0 mW |
| 0805 | 0.125 W | 62.5 mW |
| 1206 | 0.5 W | 250.0 mW |

**Design rule:** the continuous dissipation P = I²·R of every resistor must not exceed 50 % of its
footprint's rated power. Pick the footprint for the power, not just the value.

# XTAL_CL18 — 2-pin fundamental-mode quartz crystal

## Pinout
| Pin | Pad | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | crystal terminal |
| 2 | 2 | crystal terminal |

(Non-polarised.) Value = nominal frequency, e.g. `16M`.

## Electrical characteristics
- **Rated load capacitance CL = 18 pF**
- Frequency tolerance ±20 ppm at rated CL
- ESR ≤ 60 Ω; shunt capacitance C0 = 3 pF; drive level ≤ 100 µW

## Application notes
- Pierce oscillator: one load capacitor from each crystal pin to GND.
  Effective load CL_eff = C1·C2/(C1+C2) + Cstray (Cstray = MCU pin + PCB capacitance).
  For C1 = C2: C = 2·(CL - Cstray). Must be within ±10 % of 18 pF or the oscillator runs off-frequency.
- Keep traces short and the load capacitors next to the crystal.

## Value notation (all parts)

A value is `<number><SI prefix?><unit?>`, e.g. `4.7k`, `100n`, `2.2u`, `10R`, `1meg`, `1.5e3`:
- number: digits with an optional decimal point and an optional exponent (`1e3`); no sign, no
  digit grouping, no RKM notation (`4k7`);
- SI prefix (case-sensitive): `p` `n` `u`/`µ`/`μ` (micro) `m` (milli) `k`/`K` `M`/`meg`/`MEG` (mega) `G`;
  an exponent and a prefix together (`1e3k`) are rejected;
- unit letters, optional, must match the part: R `Ω`/`ohm`/`Ohm`/`R`; C `F`; L `H`; crystals `Hz`;
  other parts none (`100nH` on a capacitor is rejected);
- no whitespace or control characters inside the value (leading/trailing spaces are ignored).

design.json and the board must carry the same value; they are compared as numbers (`1k` == `1000`).

## 2. Reviewer-only (hidden from the agent)

### 2.1 Injected faults

| # | type | category | DRC/ERC-invisible | latent (pcbtool-clean) | detail | verifier, this fault alone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `decap_misconnected` | connectivity | yes |  | C3 supply-side pin C3.1 tied to GND (cap shorted out, should be on +3V3) | reward 0.0; fails layout, topology |
| 2 | `footprint_swap` | board | no |  | Y1 footprint changed to Crystal:Crystal_SMD_3215-2Pin_3.2x1.5mm (was Crystal:Crystal_SMD_2012-2Pin_2.0x1.2mm); tracks no longer fit | reward 0.0; fails drc |
| 3 | `broken_trace` | board | no |  | track of net NRST on F.Cu cut near (127.02, 123.02) | reward 0.0; fails drc |

### 2.2 Reference fix (faulted → golden)

The reference repair is the hidden golden pair (`golden_design.json`, `golden_board.kicad_pcb`). Any repair that passes every gate and check scores 1.0; it need not be byte-identical.

**design.json: component changes**

- `Y1` footprint: `Crystal:Crystal_SMD_3215-2Pin_3.2x1.5mm` → `Crystal:Crystal_SMD_2012-2Pin_2.0x1.2mm`

**design.json: connection changes** (per pin: what it connects to)

- `C3.1`: faulted net `GND` (C1.2, C2.2, C3.2, J1.2, U1.GND) → golden net `+3V3` (J1.1, R1.1, U1.VDD)

**board.kicad_pcb: footprints moved / changed**

- `Y1` footprint `Crystal:Crystal_SMD_3215-2Pin_3.2x1.5mm` → `Crystal:Crystal_SMD_2012-2Pin_2.0x1.2mm`

**board.kicad_pcb: footprint values (BOM)**

- none

**board.kicad_pcb: pad-net changes**

- `C1` pad 1: net `Net-(C1-Pad1)` → `XIN`
- `C2` pad 1: net `Net-(C2-Pad1)` → `XOUT`
- `C3` pad 1: net `GND` → `+3V3`
- `U1` pad 2: net `Net-(C1-Pad1)` → `XIN`
- `U1` pad 3: net `Net-(C2-Pad1)` → `XOUT`

**board.kicad_pcb: nets re-routed** (track/via geometry differs)

- net `+3V3`: 3 track/via item(s) removed, 6 added
- net `GND`: 14 track/via item(s) removed, 16 added
- net `NRST`: 2 track/via item(s) removed, 1 added
- net `Net-(C1-Pad1)`: 5 track/via item(s) removed, 0 added
- net `Net-(C2-Pad1)`: 8 track/via item(s) removed, 0 added
- net `XIN`: 0 track/via item(s) removed, 5 added
- net `XOUT`: 0 track/via item(s) removed, 8 added

Golden renders (compare with 1.2; highlighted items differ):

### 2.4 Spec assertions before / after

| assertion | what | allowed | faulted: measured | | golden: measured | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `xtal_load_capacitance` | crystal Y1 effective load capacitance within ±10 % of its rated CL (stray 2.5 pF) | see def. | 17.5 p | ✅ | 17.5 p | ✅ |

### 2.5 Value bounds

Bounds are public (TASK.md / spec.json); `values` check = every value inside its range.

| ref | part | acceptable range | faulted design.json | faulted board | golden | touched by a fault |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `C1` | C | 10 pF … 95 pF | `30p` | `30p` | `30p` |  |
| `C2` | C | 11 pF … 100 pF | `30p` | `30p` | `30p` |  |

### 2.6 Layout rules

- power net `+3V3` (golden pins C3.1, J1.1, R1.1, U1.VDD): every track ≥ 0.3 mm
- power net `GND` (golden pins C1.2, C2.2, C3.2, J1.2, U1.GND): every track ≥ 0.3 mm
- decoupling: `C3` within 6.0 mm of copper path (and 5.0 mm straight-line) of `U1.VDD`

### 2.8 Design rules (`rules` check, not run by pcbtool)

Scope: resistor power only (`rules_power`, all v2 tiers); 1 operating condition(s) from the spec's stimuli; 1 rule quantities evaluated per design. Rows shown: violated on either side, on a part a fault touches (if ≥ 5 % of its limit or changed by ≥ 5 points or by a footprint change), or at ≥ 80% of the limit. Values are the worst case over the conditions (computed with `pcbenv.rules.operating_point`; limits from `pcbenv/rules.py`, stated in `parts/<PART>.md` and TASK.md "Design rules").

- no rule quantity is violated, touched by a fault, or within 80 % of a limit

Rule violations reported by the verifier: faulted: none; golden: none.

## 3. Review

Fill `review.yaml` in this directory (second reviewer: copy `../../review_template.yaml` to `review-<initials>.yaml` here, without looking at the first form). Questions to answer:

1. **task_fair / solvable_from_public_material**: from section 1 only, can a competent engineer locate and fix every injected fault? Is anything required that is not stated (a value with no assertion and no published range, a connection only the golden reveals)?
2. **reference_fix_correct**: is the golden (2.2) a correct design that meets the stated intent?
3. **verifier_verdict_agrees**: do you agree the faulted files fail and the golden passes, for the reasons given in 2.3?
4. **alternative_valid_fixes_rejected**: is there an engineering-valid repair the grader would reject (e.g. a different E-series value that meets intent but fails an assertion window or value bound; keeping a swapped footprint and re-routing; a different valid placement)?
5. **rule_stated_clearly**: is every design rule / layout rule / latent requirement this task grades (2.7–2.9) stated in the public material clearly enough that an engineer would apply it the way the grader does (limit, which part, which condition)? Normal-tier tasks: answer for the resistor-power rule (`yes` if no rule is involved).
6. **layout_rule_reasonable**: hard_layout tasks only (else `n/a`): are the layout-rule limits and their geometric definitions (2.9) defensible engineering practice for this board, i.e. would you reject the faulted layout in a design review, and accept the golden one?
